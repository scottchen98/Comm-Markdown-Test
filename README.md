# Overview of GitHub Documentation

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This documentation will guide you through setting up Local and [**GitHub**](https://github.com) repositories through the Command-Line Interface (CLI).

> :fontawesome-brands-github:{ .github } [**GitHub**](https://github.com) is a cross-platform hosting service, that allows developers to host and review code, manage projects and software releases, and collaborate with other developers.

## Intended Users

This documentation is targeted towards the following users:

- Beginner to intermediate developers who need to keep track of their source code using Git.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

The documentation assumes the following:

- No prior knowledge is required.

## Software Requirements

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:

- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

> Although the Git commands used will be on VS Code, they can also be done in your CLI outside of VS Code. Such as Terminal in Mac OS or Command Line in Windows.

## Procedures Overview

The main sections of the documentation are summarized below:

- **[Home](docs/index.md)**
- **[Git Basics](docs/Gitbasics.md)**
- **[Pushing Code With Git](docs/Pushingcodewithgit.md)**
- **[Troubleshooting](docs/TroubleShooting.md)**
- **[Glossary](docs/Glossary.md)**

## Notes and Warning Messages

Throughout the documentation, we will use message blocks to alert you to relevant information. 
Each possible message block, from most important to least important:

!!! danger
    Specifies actions that may cause an error or will cause the application to crash.

[comment]: <> (!!! failure)

[comment]: <> (    Specifies actions that may lead to unexpected behaviour.)

[comment]: <> (!!! bug)

[comment]: <> (    Specifies actions that may cause an error.)

!!! warning
    Specifies content that must be read before proceeding.

!!! Info
    Indicates additional information or tips.

!!! success
    Indicates what success looks like.












# Overview of Express User Documentation

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This documentation will guide you through setting up Local and [**GitHub**](https://github.com) repositories through the Command-Line Interface (CLI).

The goal of this documentation is to provide you with enough information to use Git and to build your very first remote repository.

These are the topics of this document

- Introduction to Git Installation
- Git Basics
- Pushing Code With Git
- Troubleshooting
- Glossary

## How We Collaborated Together

This user guide assignment occurred while our classes were completely held in-class. Our main form of communication was over Discord and in-person to brainstorm our ideas to get the basic structure for our markdown.

We used Git and GitHub to collaborate on the documentation. We divided the tasks between us by creating our own branches to keep our work separate until we were ready to merge to the master branch.

## How We Created Our Guide

Our guide was created using our knowledge from setting up and using Express servers in COMP 2340 Collaboration Tools. We referenced the official [Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en) to supplement our experiential knowledge.

### Using MkDocs

We chose to use MkDocs as our static site generator as we liked the appearance of the [Material for MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) theme, and the components provided by MkDocs.

### Using Markdown

This was the first time writing extensively in markdown for both of us. We learned how to style text using markdown from our COMM 2116 Business Communications 2 and developed our skills over the course of writing this documentation.

### Using VS Code

All the members of the group used VS Code to write our markdown files. We previewed the markdown using VS Code's built-in markdown preview, but we had to serve our guide with MkDocs to see the accurate rendering of our styles.

### Using a Style Guide

We loosely used the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style) to give our writing uniformity. We had previously used this style guide and its clear documentation made it an attractive style guide to reference.

We used codeblocks to represent Git commands as well as annotations. This allowed us to explain specific lines of code without disrupting the visual flow.

### Learning Best Practices For Web Writing

In addition to user guides, developers also write documentation for their peers and company stakeholders. Most of this writing exists in a web format. As such, it is important to construct documents that maximize readability on the web.

#### Readability

People read technical writing to retrieve information and not for pleasure (typically). We streamlined our writing to be clear, concise, and complete to provide the necessary information as effectively as possible.

We ensured that every procedure page included a conclusion to summarize what the reader would have accomplished from following the guide.

We used MkDocs' admonitions to highlight any information we wanted to stand out to the reader.

  <figcaption>Specifies actions that may cause an error or will cause the application to crash.</figcaption>

[comment]: <> (  <figcaption>Specifies actions that may lead to unexpected behaviour.</figcaption>)

[comment]: <> (  <img)

[comment]: <> (  src="docs/pages/images/admonitions/failure.png")

[comment]: <> (  alt="The failure admonition.">)

[comment]: <> (</figure>)

[comment]: <> (  <figcaption>Specifies actions that may cause an error.</figcaption>)

[comment]: <> (  <img)

[comment]: <> (  src="docs/pages/images/admonitions/bug.png")

[comment]: <> (  alt="The bug admonition.">)

[comment]: <> (</figure>)

<figure>
  <figcaption>Indicates what success looks like.</figcaption>

</figure>

#### Chunking

Due to the nature of our topic, we anticipated long informative pages. This can easily become difficult for a reader to follow. Knowing this, we focused on using sub-headings and figures to guide the reader.

We chose a navigation style (from MkDocs) that would show the subheadings for the current page as nested links. This allows our reader to gauge the relevancy of the material and to jump to a specific section if they desired.

#### Tone

This documentation is intended for the following users who are searching for a clear guide to using Git and setting up a GitHub repository:

- Beginner to intermediate developers who need to keep track of their source code.

Therefore, we chose to write in a casual tone as if we were explaining to a peer. We kept the jargon to a minimal as we did not want to confuse any beginner coders. Any specialized terminology included a hyperlink to an external resource if the reader needed further explanation.

## Conclusion

This documentation recorded our understanding of Git/Github. The topic was tedious for us to write because we had to repeat the same Git command multiple times to ensure the user sees the file changes. Writing this documentation presented us the opportunity to practice writing clear instructions for our intended audience to read off the web.

This project tested our group's ability to communicate. As a group, we had an open line of communication where we regularly updated each other on our progress. Through solid teamwork, we helped each other adhere to a common style guide.

Thank you for your interest in our Git Documentation. We hope this documentation can be a good reference for our readers and for ourselves in future projects.
