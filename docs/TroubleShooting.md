| **Symptoms** | **Probable Cause** | **Action** |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ---------- |
| `fatal: Authentication failed for [repository URL]` | This error message indicates that Git was unable to authenticate with the remote repository. | Double-check your login information and try again. |
| `fatal: not a git repository` | This error message means that you tried to run a Git command in a directory that is not a Git repository or a subdirectory of a Git repository. In other words, Git does not recognize the directory you are in as a place where it can track changes to files. | Double-check that you are in the correct directory or subdirectory of a Git repository. You can verify if a directory is a Git repository by checking for the presence of a ".git" folder within the directory.|
|  `fatal: remote origin already exists`   | This error message means that you are trying to add a remote repository with a name "origin" which already exists in your Git repository. | Use a different name when adding the remote repository. Instead of using the default name "origin", you can use any other name of your choice. For example, you can use "myrepo" instead of "origin" when adding the remote repository. |
| `fatal: git checkout: updating paths is incompatible with switching branches` | This error occurs when you try to switch branches while having uncommitted changes in your working directory. | You can resolve this by committing your changes or stashing them.|
| `error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:[file names]` | This error message indicates that you have made changes to one or more files that conflict with changes made in the remote repository. Git is preventing the `git pull` command from overwriting your local changes. | Commit your local changes using the `git commit` command before running the `git pull` command.|
